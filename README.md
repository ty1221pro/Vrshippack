Any reskinned megafreight ships I give credit to 1010todd I just reskinned them
credit to Zoura for me using the amphibious ships turrets and the sprites for the turrets as I do not own them
Credit to midnight for the ion burst zapper Idea and using the sprites as I do not own them. 
and finally do not redistribute or edit the ships I made and kitbashed without my permission.
I also give credit to todd again for the ichra railguns. I added them because they were really cool. also the only sound for the ichra guns I also give todd credit for that as well.
