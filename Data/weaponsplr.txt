	description `The earliest phases of this weapon's development harken back to before the Navarchs even first came into contact with the Quarg; an early attempt at using energy to replace the fuel in a Hyperdrive's operation, allowing a planet to theoretically launch fighters without any need for deuterium or worry of fallout from the fusion explosion that powers a Hyperdrive. The device failed, and was shelved for millenia.`
	description `	Relatively recently, however, some attention was brought back to the device, with the hopes that it could be turned into an effective weapon against swarms of Quarg Automata. The resultant weapon fires enormous yottrite-alloy slugs at near-light speed, causing an explosive effect on target and effortlessly cutting through all in its way.`
	description `	(Note: The amount of contact per shot can vary with enemy size, so damage per second is approximate.)`
