	description "The ancient Sheragi superweapon is simple in concept, but the cost involved in developing something like it is exorbitant. It's hard to envision what could have motivated the creation of such a thing. It uses an obscene amount of energy to trigger an extremely powerful thermonuclear reaction, directing most of the energy from the resulting explosion forwards in a devastatingly powerful beam of gamma radiation."

	description `This outfit is sometimes referred to as the "Berserker Circuit" after the first ship it was used in. Many consider the development of this device a reckless attempt to push a ship's combat abilities to its maximum limits. But installing a Limit Breaker on your ship allows it to keep functioning well past the point that it would be disabled due to internal safety mechanisms shutting your systems down.`
	description `	However, using this isn't without risk. If your ship continues fighting a hopeless battle after it would normally be disabled, you are unlikely to be left adrift in space afterwards waiting for someone to come rescue you... Because you'd be dead.`
	description `	Installing more than one of these outfits reduces their effectiveness as they interfere with each other as well as your ship's internal safety shutdown systems.`

	description "The AIM-1x Super Sidewinder is a general purpose missile that can be used to attack all types of enemies, including ground, naval and air. It is also very useful on spacecraft due to it being a credible threat to both Capital Ships and Fighters. This version uses fabricators instead of the 'pocket dimension' to prepare missiles to be fired."
